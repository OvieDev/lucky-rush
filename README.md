# Lucky Rush
Get ready to play an original game packed inside a nice discord bot with some additional features! It's free, it's awesome. What is not to like?

# Game Description
To play this game, you will need 2 other friends. The game is divided into rounds. There are 10 in total\
**YOUR GOAL: Get to the finish line as fast as you can**\
\------\
Each round you have two options. Or to **CHECK** the "luckybox", or to **PASS** it.\
\------\
Luckyboxes contain a surprise for you, to use as a advantage for you or as a disadvantage for other players. Sadly, in those boxes you may also find some not cool stuff.\
\------\
Every round you move one step closer to the finish line after every action (except when your (or other player's) luckybox said otherwise) \
\------\
At round 5 and 10 you **MUST** check the box.\
\-------\
So there you have it. Have fun playing!!!
