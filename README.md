# Lucky Rush
Lucky Rush is a discord bot which provides a lot of fun features and games for the entire server. But it's main feature is
a game called "Lucky Rush", where randomness is your blessing, and a curse in the same time, although you can find some
strategy elements here and there.

# Game Description
To play this game, you will need 2 other friends. The game is divided into rounds.\
**YOUR GOAL: Get to the finish line as fast as you can**\
\------\
Each round you have two options. Or to **CHECK** the "luckybox", or to **PASS** it.\
\------\
Luckyboxes contain a surprise for you, to use as a advantage for you or as a disadvantage for other players. Sadly, in those boxes you may also find some not cool stuff.\
\------\
Every round you move one step closer to the finish line after every action (except when your (or other player's) luckybox said otherwise) \
\------\
In every luckybox there's also one of three cards. Action, counter or trap card.\
\------\
Action cards do many unpleasant stuff to your enemies. If your enemy will not respond with a counter card, that enemy will be a victim of your action card.
However, if he will respond with a counter card, you will become a victim of your own action card. It's important to note, that when you draw actions cards or counter cards, you're not moving.\
\------\
When you draw a trap card, you select a field where you want to set your trap. However, you don't know what player will encounter your trap (it could even be you!). When you draw a trap card, you move one field, as you would normally\
\------\
At round 5 and 10 you **MUST** check the box.\
\-------\
So there you have it. Have fun playing!!!
